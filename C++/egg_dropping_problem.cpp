// PROBLEM STATEMENT :
// we wish to know which stories in a no_of_floor -story building are safe to drop eggs from, 
// and which will cause the eggs to break on landing. We make a few assumptions:
// …..An egg that survives a fall can be used again. 
// …..A broken egg must be discarded. 
// …..The effect of a fall is the same for all eggs. 
// …..If an egg breaks when dropped, then it would break if dropped from a higher floor. 
// …..If an egg survives a fall then it would survive a shorter fall. 
// …..It is not ruled out that the first-floor windows break eggs, nor is it ruled out that the 36th-floor do not cause an egg to break.
// If only one egg is available and we wish to be sure of obtaining the right result, the experiment can be 
// carried out in only one way. Drop the egg from the first-floor window; if it survives, drop it from the 
// second-floor window. Continue upward until it breaks. 
// THE TASK IS TO FIND MINIMUM NUMBER OF TRIALS IN WORST CASE TO FIND WHICH FLOORS ARE SAFE FOR DROPPING EGG
// problem statement is taken from geeksforgeeks
