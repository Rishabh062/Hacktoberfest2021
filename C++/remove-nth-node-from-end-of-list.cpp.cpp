/*QS:
Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.
 
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Example 2:

Input: head = [1], n = 1
Output: []
Example 3:

Input: head = [1,2], n = 1
Output: [1]
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the list is sz.
1 <= sz <= 30
0 <= Node.val <= 100
1 <= n <= sz
*/

// Solution:

ListNode *removeNthFromEnd(ListNode *head, int n) 
{
    if (!head)
        return nullptr;

    ListNode new_head(-1);
    new_head.next = head;

    ListNode *slow = &new_head, *fast = &new_head;

    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
        fast = fast->next;

    while (fast->next) 
    {
        fast = fast->next;
        slow = slow->next;
    }

    ListNode *to_de_deleted = slow->next;
    slow->next = slow->next->next;
    
    delete to_be_deleted;

    return new_head.next;
}
