""" Given strings s1 and s2, you need to find if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1. 
The strings are lowercase.

Input:
The first line of the input contains a single integer T, denoting the number of test cases. 
Then T test case follows. Each testcase contains two lines for s1 and s2.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, you need to print 1 if s2 is a rotated version of s1; else print 0.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 103
1 <= |s1|, |s2| <= 107

Example:
Input:
4
geeksforgeeks
forgeeksgeeks
mightandmagic
andmagicmigth
mushroomkingdom
itsamemario
geekofgeeks
geeksgeekof

Output:
1
0
0
1

Explanation:
Testcase 1: s1 is geeksforgeeks, s2 is forgeeksgeeks. 
Clearly, s2 is a rotated version of s1 as s2 can be obtained by left-rotating s1 by 5 units. """
