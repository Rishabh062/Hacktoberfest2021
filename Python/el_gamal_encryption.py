# In cryptography, the ElGamal encryption system is an asymmetric key encryption algorithm for public-key cryptography
# which is based on the Diffieâ€“Hellman key exchange. It was described by Taher Elgamal in 1985.
# ElGamal encryption is used in the free GNU Privacy Guard software, recent versions of PGP, and other cryptosystems.
# The Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA) is a variant of the ElGamal signature scheme, which should not be confused with ElGamal encryption.

# to undestand described parameters, please, refer to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ElGamal_encryption

m = int(input('Enter m paremeter: ')) #7

# Caluclation  of the public key
h = pow(g, x) % p

# Caluclation  of the ciphertext
c1 = pow(g, k) % p
c2 = pow(h, k) * m % p

# Description of the ciphertext
