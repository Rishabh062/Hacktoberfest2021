""" Given a sequence of strings, 
the task is to find out the second most repeated (or frequent) string in the given sequence.

Note: No two strings are the second most repeated, there will be always a single string.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. 
Then T test cases follow. Each test case consists of two lines. 
First line of each test case contains an Integer N denoting number of strings in a 
sequence and the second line contains N space separated strings.

Output:
For each test case, in a new line print the second most repeated string.

Constraints:
1<=T<=100
3<=N<=103
1<=|String length|<=100

Example:
Input:
2
6
aaa bbb ccc bbb aaa  aaa
6

Output:
