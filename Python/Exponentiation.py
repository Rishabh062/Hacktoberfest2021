# Exponentiation
# Exponentiation is the raising of one number to the power of another.
# This operation is performed using two asterisks **.
# Let's use exponentiation to solve a known problem.
# You are offered a choice of either $1.000.000 or $0.01 (one penny) doubled every day for 30 days (the resulting amount is doubled every day).
# 
# Task:
# Write a program to calculate the amount that will result from the doubling to understand which choice results in a larger amount.
#
#Hint:
# Let's see how exponentiation can be useful to perform the calculation.
# For example, if we want to calculate how much money we will have on the 5th day, we can use this expression: 0.01*(2**5) = 0.32 dollars (multiply the penny by 2 raised to the power of 5).
# Use the print statement to output the resulting amount. 
print (0.01 *(2 **30))
