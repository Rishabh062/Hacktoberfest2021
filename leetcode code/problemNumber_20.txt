Given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.

An input string is valid if:

    Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
    Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
    Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
Example 1:

Input: s = "()"
Output: true

Example 2:

Input: s = "()[]{}"
Output: true

Example 3:

Input: s = "(]"
Output: false

 

Constraints:

    1 <= s.length <= 104
    s consists of parentheses only '()[]{}'.
