 
Typing is the basic command to run a computer and your typing speed plays vital role while working in computer to save time. Here I have presented a Typing Tutor Project in C to measure userâ€™s typing speed and to enhance their typing speed. This is a simple console application written in C programming language, and compiled using GNU GCC compiler on Code::Blocks IDE.
  
  The source code of Typing Tutor Project in C consists of over 600 lines of code which are made user friendly by attaching comments to describe the function of each command. The project source code effectively utilizes the user defined functions and the concept of file handling.
  
  Features:

This project provides certain name as user by default and there a facility to create a new user too. You can enter your name as user.
In the project, you can view the total statistics.
The record option in the project is for displaying the data of user which has already used the application. you can view typing speed, accuracy etc.
If you want to terminate the program without any use, you can select exit option in the main menu.
